## 🧠 Systems Analysis & Design Overview

Welcome to my learning journey through the key topics of **Systems Analysis and Design (SAD)**. Each topic represents a foundational step in developing efficient, user-focused information systems.

---

### 📘 Topic 1 – Fundamentals of System Analysis & Design  
Understanding the basics of system development life cycle (SDLC), types of information systems, and the critical role of a systems analyst in solving business problems through technology.

---

### 🗂️ Topic 2 – Project Planning Process  
Covers the planning phase of system development, including defining scope, estimating resources, and creating project schedules using tools like Gantt and PERT charts.

---

### 🔍 Topic 3 – Information Gathering  
Focuses on techniques like interviews, surveys, document analysis, and observation to collect accurate user and system requirements for successful system development.

---

### 🔄 Topic 4 (Part 1) – The Analysis Process (Data Flow Diagram)  
Introduces DFDs as a visual tool to represent how data flows through the system—highlighting inputs, processes, data stores, and outputs.

---

### 📝 Topic 4 (Part 2) – Process Specification  
Details how each process in a DFD is described using structured tools such as structured English, decision tables, and decision trees for better logic and clarity.

---

### 📊 Topic 4 (Part 3) – Structure Chart  
Presents a modular, hierarchical view of the system’s components. Helps identify the relationships between modules for better program structure and maintainability.

---

### 🎨 Topic 5 – Design Task  
Focuses on designing user-friendly input/output screens, databases, and system architecture. Emphasizes clarity, usability, and functionality.

---

### ⚙️ Topic 6 – Systems Implementation  
Covers converting the system design into a working solution through coding, testing, deployment, user training, and documentation.
